# Interests

I do like solving problems with Software, currently mostly in the domain of (L4) automated driving. But besides that, I also try to promote the principles of information transparency, data-driven thinking & error culture within my team.

Even more important than that is my family and –you guessed it– coffee & pizza. To be able to enjoy plenty of it, I go running and biking regularly. :-)

# Background

Since 2021, I've worked as Senior Research Engineer for Machine Learning Deployment at <a href="https://www.bosch-ai.com/" target="_blank">BCAI</a>.

From 2015 – 2021 I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.mrt.kit.edu/" target="_blank">MRT</a> / <a href="https://www.kit.edu/" target="_blank">KIT</a> working on _Traffic Scene Perception for Automated Driving with Top-View Grid Maps_, ending in my <a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000133783" target="_blank">dissertation</a>. You can find a complete list of publications I contributed to on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t85IPDwAAAAJ" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>.

Before that, I studied _Electrical Engineering_ at <a href="https://www.kit.edu/" target="_blank">KIT</a> from 2008 – 2015 with a few stops in Reutlingen, Farmington Hills & Sunnyvale for internships and bachelor-/master theses, respectively.
