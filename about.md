# Interests

I do like solving problems with Software, currently mostly in the domain of (L4) automated driving. But besides that, I also try to promote the principles of information transparency, data-driven thinking & error culture within my team.

Even more important than that is my family and –you guessed it– coffee & pizza. To be able to enjoy plenty of it, I go running and biking regularly. :-)

# Background

Since 2021, I've worked as Senior Research Engineer for Machine Learning Deployment at [BCAI](https://www.bosch-ai.com/).

From 2015 – 2021 I was a PhD student at [MRT](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/) / [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) working on _Traffic Scene Perception for Automated Driving with Top-View Grid Maps_. You can find my dissertation [here](https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000133783) and a complete list of publications I contributed to on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t85IPDwAAAAJ).

Before that, I studied _Electrical Engineering_ at [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) from 2008 – 2015 with a few stops in Reutlingen, Farmington Hills & Sunnyvale for internships and bachelor-/master theses, respectively.
